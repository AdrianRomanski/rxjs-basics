/**Collect and subscribe to all observables.
 *
 * ðŸ’¡ In many cases you can use mergeMap as a single operator instead!
 *
 * Why use mergeAll?
 * This operator is best used when you have multiple, short-lived observables that produce values
 * independently and you want to flatten them into a single output stream.
 * Real-world examples of this can be seen in scenarios like processing multiple requests simultaneously,
 * where each request is an observable and the responses need to be combined into a single stream.
 * Consider a web page that displays live news updates from different sources.
 * Each source produces updates as separate observables,
 * and you want to merge them all together to show a single feed of news updates. In this case, mergeAll can come to the rescue.
 * It's essential to note that mergeAll will start emitting values as soon as any of the inner observables emit a value.
 * This is different from combineLatest, which waits for each observable to emit at least one value before producing an output.
 * When deciding between mergeAll and other operators, keep in mind the following:
 * If you need to merge multiple observables that rely on each other for calculations or decisions, combineLatest may be more suitable.
 * If you're working with observables that only emit one value or you only require the last value
 * of each before completion, forkJoin is likely a better choice.
 * If you need to merge observables that produce values independently and are short-lived, mergeAll is the operator to reach for.
