/** Collect observables and subscribe to next when previous completes.
 *
 * âš  Be wary of backpressure when the source emits at a faster pace than inner observables complete!
 *
 * ðŸ’¡ In many cases you can use concatMap as a single operator instead!
 *
 * Why use concatAll?
 * This operator is best used when you have multiple observables that need to be processed sequentially,
 * ensuring that each observable completes before moving on to the next.
 * Real-world examples of this can be seen in scenarios such as uploading multiple files
 * to a server one-by-one, or displaying a sequence of animations in order.
 *
 *
 * Bear in mind that concatAll will only start processing the next observable when the current one completes.
 * This is an important consideration if you have observables that emit values indefinitely
 * or take a long time to complete, as it may cause a delay in processing subsequent observables.
 *
 * Additionally, if you're working with observables that can emit values concurrently
 * and don't need to wait for one to complete before processing another,
 * mergeAll might be a more suitable choice. Similarly, if you only need to combine the values
 * of multiple observables at the point when they all complete, forkJoin could be a better option.
 *

    obs3: 0 (complete)
