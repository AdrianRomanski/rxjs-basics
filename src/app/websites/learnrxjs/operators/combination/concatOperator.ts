/** Subscribe to observables in order as previous completes
 *
 * ðŸ’¡ You can think of concat like a line at a ATM, the next transaction (subscription)
 * cannot start until the previous completes!
 * ðŸ’¡ If throughput, not order, is a primary concern, try merge instead!
 *
 * Why use concat?
 * The concat operator is best used when you need to combine multiple observables,
 * but you want their emissions to be in a specific order, one after the other.
 * It's like putting together a puzzle where the pieces must come together sequentially to create the full picture.
 * An example of this can be seen in a real-world scenario,
 * like downloading and displaying several images in the correct order,
 * where you don't want the next image to load until the current one is fully loaded.
 *
 * Keep in mind that concat will only start emitting values from the next observable
 * once the previous one has completed. This means that if one of your observables never completes,
 * the subsequent observables will never emit any values.
 * This behavior can be a gotcha, as there will be no output and no error,
 * but one (or more) of your inner observables might not be functioning as intended,
 * or a subscription is not being set up correctly.
 *
 *
 * In contrast, if you need to combine observables that emit values concurrently,
 * or you require the latest values from multiple observables whenever any of them emit a new value,
 * combineLatest or withLatestFrom might be more suitable options.
