/** Turn multiple observables into a single observable.
 * ðŸ’¡ This operator can be used as either a static or instance method!
 * ðŸ’¡ If order not throughput is a primary concern, try concat instead!
 *
 * Why use merge?
 * The merge operator is your go-to solution when you have multiple observables that produce values independently
 * and you want to combine their output into a single stream. Think of it as a highway merger, where multiple roads
 * join together to form a single, unified road - the traffic (data) from each road (observable) flows seamlessly together.
 * A real-world example can be seen in a chat application, where you have separate observables for receiving messages
 * from multiple users. By using merge, you can bring all those message streams into a
 * single unified stream for displaying the messages in the chat window.
 * Keep in mind that merge will emit values as soon as any of the observables emit a value.
 * This is different from combineLatest or withLatestFrom, which wait for each observable
 * to emit at least one value before emitting a combined value.
 * Lastly, if you're dealing with observables that emit values at specific intervals
 * and you need to combine them based on time, consider using the zip operator instead.
