/** Also provide the last value from another observable.
 *
 * ðŸ’¡ If you want the last emission
 * any time a variable number of observables emits, try combinelatest!
 *
 * The withLatestFrom operator is your best friend when you have one main observable whose emissions depend on the
 * latest values from one or more other observables. Think of it as a one-way data flow, where the primary observable
 * takes the lead and other observables chime in with their most recent values.
 * A classic example to remember withLatestFrom is a chat application that needs to send a message with a user's current location.
 * The message sending event (main observable) combines with the latest location data (another observable) to form the final message object.
 * Keep in mind that withLatestFrom only emits a value when the main observable emits,
 * and after each additional observable has emitted at least once. This can catch you off guard,
 * as you might not see any output or errors while one of the observables isn't behaving as expected, or a subscription is delayed.
 * If you need to combine values from multiple observables that emit more than once and are interdependent,
 * consider using combineLatest instead. And for scenarios where observables emit only once or you just need their last values, forkJoin might be a more suitable choice.
