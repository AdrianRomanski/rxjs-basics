/** Emit given value first.
 * ðŸ’¡ A BehaviorSubject can also start with an initial value!
 *
 * Why use startWith?
 * The startWith operator is a great tool when you need to provide an initial value to an observable sequence,
 * ensuring that the consumer always receives a value upon subscription. It's a handy way to set a default state or
 * value for your observables, making it easier for subscribers to handle the data
 * and minimizing the chances of encountering unexpected scenarios.
 * A real-world example can be seen in a search functionality, where the search results should display
 * a list of popular items as a default state before the user starts typing their query.
 * By using startWith, you can seamlessly provide this default data to your subscribers.
 * Keep in mind that startWith emits the initial value immediately upon subscription.
 * This behavior is helpful when you want to make sure your subscribers receive a value right away,
 * even before the source observable starts emitting values.
 *
