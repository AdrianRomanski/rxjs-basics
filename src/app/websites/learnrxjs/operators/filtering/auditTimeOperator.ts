/** Ignore for given time then emit most recent value
 * Why use auditTime
 * When you are interested in ignoring a source observable for a given amount of time,
 * you can use auditTime. A possible use case is to only emit certain events (i.e. mouse clicks)
 * at a maximum rate per second. After the specified duration has passed, the timer
 * is disabled and the most recent source value is emitted on the output Observable,
 * and this process repeats for the next source value.
 * ðŸ’¡ If you want the timer to reset whenever a new event occurs
 * on the source observable, you can use debounceTime
