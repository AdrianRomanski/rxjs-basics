/** Emit provided number of values before completing.
 *
 * Why use take?
 * When you are interested in only the first emission, you want to use take.
 * Maybe you want to see what the user first clicked on when they entered the page,
 * or you would want to subscribe to the click event and just take the first emission.
 * Another use-case is when you need to take a snapshot of data at a particular
 * point in time but do not require further emissions. For example, a stream
 * of user token updates, or a route guard based on a stream in an Angular application.
 *
 * ðŸ’¡ If you want to take a variable number of values based on some logic,
 * or another observable, you can use takeUntil or takeWhile!
 * ðŸ’¡ take is the opposite of skip where take will take the
 * first n number of emissions while skip will skip the first n number of emissions.
